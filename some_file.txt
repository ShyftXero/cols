this may seem obvious. But, for my purposes, 
this makes it much slower than simply opening the 


entire file and reading it into a string, as above.

Currently I run the script above like

$ pythonscript textfilename1 > 

here are some tabs
                spaces before me    spaces before me too
				tabs before me     tabs separate    me
end of tabs
